Here’s a basic Azure CI/CD pipeline script for deploying a Vite React app to Azure. This example assumes you're using Azure Pipelines for CI/CD and deploying to Azure Static Web Apps or Azure App Service. You may need to modify the script based on your deployment environment.

### Azure Pipelines YAML (`azure-pipelines.yml`)

```yaml
# Azure Pipelines configuration file
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main # Trigger pipeline on changes to main branch

pool:
  vmImage: "ubuntu-latest" # Use the latest Ubuntu VM

steps:
  - task: NodeTool@0
    inputs:
      versionSpec: "16.x" # Ensure Node.js 16.x is installed (or change to your Node version)
    displayName: "Install Node.js"

  - script: |
      npm install --legacy-peer-deps
      npm run build
    displayName: "Install dependencies and build"

  - task: CopyFiles@2
    inputs:
      SourceFolder: "dist" # Build output directory for Vite is 'dist'
      Contents: "**"
      TargetFolder: "$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/dist"
    displayName: "Copy build artifacts"

  - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
    inputs:
      PathtoPublish: "$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/dist"
      ArtifactName: "drop"
    displayName: "Publish build artifacts"

  - task: AzureStaticWebApp@0 # If deploying to Azure Static Web Apps
    inputs:
      app_location: "dist" # Path to build output
      azure_static_web_apps_api_token: $(deployment_token) # Azure Static Web Apps deployment token
    displayName: "Deploy to Azure Static Web Apps"
```

### Steps Breakdown:

1. **Trigger on the `main` branch** – CI/CD will be triggered on any commits to the `main` branch.
2. **Use Node.js** – Ensures Node.js 16.x is installed (or change this to match your Node version).
3. **Install Dependencies and Build** – Installs the required packages and runs `npm run build` to build the Vite app (which outputs files to the `dist` directory by default).
4. **Copy and Publish Artifacts** – Copies the build output (`dist` folder) and publishes it as build artifacts.
5. **Deploy to Azure Static Web Apps** – Deploys the built Vite app to Azure Static Web Apps using the deployment token. Alternatively, modify this section if you are deploying to an Azure App Service or other targets.

### Notes:

- Replace `$(deployment_token)` with your Azure Static Web Apps deployment token, or use an Azure service connection if deploying to Azure App Service.
- If you are using App Service instead of Static Web Apps, use the `AzureWebApp` task instead for deployment.
