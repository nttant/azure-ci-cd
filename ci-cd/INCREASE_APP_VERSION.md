To automatically increment the app version in your CI/CD pipeline, you can update the version in the `package.json` file as part of the build process. Here's how you can do it in Azure Pipelines:

### Steps to Automatically Increment Version:

1. **Install `npm version`**: Use the `npm version` command to automatically bump the version.
2. **Commit and Push**: After updating the version, you'll need to commit the change back to your repository and push it to the branch.

Below is an updated version of the Azure Pipelines YAML file that includes automatic version bumping:

### Updated Azure Pipelines YAML (`azure-pipelines.yml`)

```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main # Trigger on changes to main branch

pool:
  vmImage: "ubuntu-latest" # Use the latest Ubuntu VM

steps:
  - task: NodeTool@0
    inputs:
      versionSpec: "16.x" # Ensure Node.js 16.x is installed (adjust if needed)
    displayName: "Install Node.js"

  # Step to automatically increase the version in package.json
  - script: |
      git config user.email "ci-cd@pipeline.com"
      git config user.name "Azure Pipelines"
      npm version patch --no-git-tag-version  # Increment the patch version (or use 'minor', 'major')
      git add package.json
      git commit -m "ci: bump version"
      git push origin HEAD:$(Build.SourceBranch)  # Push the version change
    displayName: "Bump version and commit"

  - script: |
      npm install --legacy-peer-deps
      npm run build
    displayName: "Install dependencies and build"

  - task: CopyFiles@2
    inputs:
      SourceFolder: ".next" # Build output directory for Next.js is '.next'
      Contents: "**"
      TargetFolder: "$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/.next"
    displayName: "Copy build artifacts"

  - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
    inputs:
      PathtoPublish: "$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/.next"
      ArtifactName: "drop"
    displayName: "Publish build artifacts"

  - task: AzureStaticWebApp@0 # Deploy to Azure Static Web Apps
    inputs:
      app_location: "." # Root of the Next.js project
      output_location: ".next" # Path to the build output
      azure_static_web_apps_api_token: $(deployment_token) # Azure Static Web Apps deployment token
    displayName: "Deploy to Azure Static Web Apps"
```

### Key Parts Explained:

1. **Increment Version**:
   - The command `npm version patch --no-git-tag-version` automatically increments the patch version in your `package.json`. You can replace `patch` with `minor` or `major` based on your versioning strategy.
   - After updating the version, the changes are committed and pushed back to the `main` branch.
2. **Git Config**:
   - The pipeline sets the git username and email using `git config` to allow committing the changes.
3. **Push Version Update**:
   - `git push origin HEAD:$(Build.SourceBranch)` pushes the changes back to the branch triggering the pipeline.

### Notes:

- Ensure that your pipeline agent has push access to the repository, which might require setting up an authentication mechanism (e.g., Azure Pipelines using a service principal or a personal access token).
- If you are using a monorepo or have other considerations, you may need to tweak the commands accordingly.

This setup will ensure the app version in `package.json` is automatically bumped on each successful deployment.
